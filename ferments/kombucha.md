# 1st fermentation

## ingredients (for a 2 gallon = 32 cups fermentation vessel)
- 26-28 cups cool, chlorine-free water
- 8-12 tea bags or 2-4 tablespoons loose-leaf tea
- 2 cup sugar
- 1 full-size kombucha SCOBY (4-5 ounces?)
- 2-4 cups mature kombucha for starter liquid (e.g. 2 cups plain mature kombucha + 2 cups scoby hotel liquid)

## directions
1. Heat 4 cups of the water to just below boiling. Combine the tea and hot water in the pot, a separate bowl, or in the brewing vessel. Let steep for 5 to 15 minutes, then remove the tea leaves.

2. Add the sugar to the hot tea, and stir until completely dissolved.

3. Pour the remaining 22-24 cups of cool water into the brewing vessel. If prepared separately, add the sweet tea. Dip a clean finger into the mixture to gauge its temperature. If warmer than body temperature (about 100°F [38°C]), cover with a clean cloth and set aside until lukewarm.

4. With clean hands, place the SCOBY in the sweet tea solution. Pour the starter liquid on top of the SCOBY; this acidifies the pH of the tea near the top of the vessel, where the culture is most vulnerable, offering a layer of protection from potential pathogens.

5. Cover the vessel with breathable cloth, secured with a rubber band if necessary. Set it in a warm location (ideally 75-85°F [24-29°C]), out of direct sunlight, unless brewing in an opaque vessel.

6. Allow the sweet tea to ferment for 7 to 21 days. After 5 days (or sooner, if you’re curious), it’s okay to begin tasting once a day. To taste, remove the cloth cover, gently insert a straw beneath the SCOBY, and take a sip. Or dip a shot glass or other small cup past the new layer of SCOBY into the brew.

7. Once the brew reaches the flavor you prefer, it is ready to harvest. Before bottling or flavoring, collect at least 1 cup of starter liquid for the next batch from the top of the brew (2 cups if you can spare it or if the brew is young) and pour it into a clean bowl. Then remove the SCOBYs to the bowl, cover with a clean towel, and set aside. (We take the liquid first because removing the cultures can kick the yeast off the bottom, which is fine for drinking but not for starter liquid.)

8. After removing the scoby and starter liquid, stir the remaining kombucha, before moving onto directions for 2nd fermentation (below).

# 2nd fermentation

## ingredients (for each 16 oz = 2 cups bottle)

## directions
0. Bottle 2 cups (1 16 oz bottle) of plain kombucha and put it in the fridge, to use as a backup for starter liquid for the next batch.
1. If you’re adding a flavoring agent, put it in the bottle. If you're adding sugar to boost carbonation, at 1/2 tsp
2. Carefully pour the fermented kombucha into the bottle and cap it. Fill bottles nearly to the top to preserve as much fizz as possible. Repeat with remaining kombucha.
3. If you like, condition the bottles by leaving them at room temperature for 1-4 days, or longer (7 days?), to build carbonation and flavor. Move them to the fridge when the kombucha attains the flavor and carbonation level you desire.
