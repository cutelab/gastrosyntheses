references "The Art of Fermentation"

# ingredients
- 8 cups milk
- 2 tablespoons - 1/2 cup yogurt (starter)

# directions
1. heat milk to at least 180°F/82°C (between 82-92 C). heat up slowly and frequently stir to avoid scalding.
2. cool milk to 115°F/46°C. you can actively cool it if you want.
3. take 1 cup of the milk and mix it with the yogurt starter.
4. once the starter is mixed into the cup of milk, mix it with the rest of the milk.
5. Incubated at 115°F/46°C, yogurt will coagulate within about 3 hours, but if left too long it can easily curdle. I prefer to ferment it a bit more slowly at a slightly lower temperature, 4-8 hours at a more forgiving 110°F/43°C. Even longer fermentations can yield more tangy flavor and fuller digestion of lactose. I have heard of people fermenting yogurt for as long as 24 hours. At lower temperatures, coagulation will take longer, and the end result will probably not be quite as thick. If you should open your incubator and find your yogurt still runny, add hot-water bottles to heat it up, and leave it for a few more hours at warmer temperatures. If for some reason your yogurt fails to coagulate at all, which can happen, you do not need to discard the milk; you can easily turn it into a simple acid-curdled cheese.
