based on https://thewoksoflife.com/shanghai-style-braised-pork-belly/

# ingredients
- 12 ounces lean, skin-on pork belly (340g)
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1 tablespoon sugar (rock sugar is preferred if you have it)
- 3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- Â½ tablespoon dark soy sauce
- ginger
- scallion
- sichuan peppercorn (not a lot, not supposed to be spicy)
- 3 anise star
- 1 cinnamon stick (optional)
- 2 cups water

# directions
1. Start by cutting your pork belly into 3/4-inch thick pieces.
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the pork belly pieces for a couple minutes. This gets rid of impurities and starts the cooking process. Take the pork out of the pot, rinse, and set aside. (optional?)
1. Over low heat, add the oil and sugar to your wok. Melt the sugar slightly and add the pork. Raise the heat to medium and cook until the pork is lightly browned.
1. Turn the heat back down to low and add ginger, scallion, shaoxing cooking wine, regular soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, anise star, cinnamon stick.
1. Add water. Cover and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour (ideally, 2 hrs) until pork is fork tender. Every 5-10 minutes, stir to prevent burning and add more water if it gets too dry.
1. Once the pork is fork tender, if there is still a lot of visible liquid, uncover the wok, turn up the heat, and stir continuously until the sauce has reduced to a glistening coating.
