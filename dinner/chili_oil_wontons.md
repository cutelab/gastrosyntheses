based on https://omnivorescookbook.com/sichuan-spicy-wonton-red-oil/

## ingredients

### Filling
- 1/2 pound (225 g) pork , minced
- 1 large egg
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1/8 teaspoon white pepper powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 green onions , finely minced
- 1 tablespoon ginger , minced
- 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns (optional)

### Sauce
- 8 tablespoons homemade chili oil plus 4 teaspoons chili flakes from the oil
- 4 tablespoons flavored sweet soy sauce (or more if you prefer a sweeter dish)
- 1 1/2 tablespoons Chinkiang vinegar
- 2 teaspoons garlic , grated
- 2 green onions , finely minced
- A few tablespoons hot water from cooking the wontons (Optional)
- Chopped cilantro, toasted ground Sichuan peppercorn flakes, and toasted sesame seeds for garnish (Optional)

## directions
1. Prepare the red oil sauce: Combine all the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Stir to mix well.
1. Make the wonton filling: Add the minced pork into a medium-sized bowl. Add the green onion, ginger, sichuan peppercorns (optional), egg, cornstarch, salt, and white pepper powder. Mix until it forms a smooth and sticky paste.
1. Make the wontons. Work on the wontons one at a time. Place about half a teaspoon of filling (or 1 teaspoon filling for bigger wontons) on the lower third of the wrapper. Fold the bottom side over the filling, then roll the filling all the way across to the other side of the wrapper. Brush a thin layer of egg white on one end of the wonton wrapper. Bind both ends and press them together to lock the filling inside the wrapper. Place on a big plate, a finger’s width apart. When you’ve finished 10 to 15 wontons, cover them with a wet paper towel to prevent them from drying out.
1. If you are not going to cook and serve the wontons immediately, you can store them in the fridge for a day, or freeze them for up to a month. Seal the tray of wontons with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer. When the wontons are completely frozen, you can transfer them to an airtight ziplock bag to free up freezer space.
1. Cook and assemble: Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the wontons, 20 at a time. Stir gently with a spatula constantly, to prevent them from sticking to the bottom. Cook until the wontons are floating on top, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer 7 to 8 wontons into each bowl. Pour 2 tablespoons of the sauce, and 2 tablespoons of the hot broth used to boil the wontons, and serve.
1. Mix the wontons well to coat them with sauce. Enjoy!

## notes
- wontons are more enjoyable if you don't overstuff them with filling.
- If cooking from frozen, it'll take a couple more minutes.
- our vegetarian (vegan if you omit egg) attempt, using shiitake mushroom and tofu, was semi-successful. it was difficult to make the mixture dry enough such that the wontons wouldn't explode when cooked. also, the filling doesn't "stick together" like the pork filling does.
