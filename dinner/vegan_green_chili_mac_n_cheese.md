## ingredients
- 10 ounces large macaroni shells
- 1/2 medium white onion (diced)
- 3-4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 cup raw cashews (soaked for 4-6 hours or overnight, then drained)
- 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth (DIY or store-bought)
- 1 Tbsp cornstarch
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 3/4 tsp chili powder
- 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 4-ounce can diced green chilies (scoop half into the sauce, reserve half for the finished mac n cheese)
- Fresh cilantro (optional // for topping)

## directions
1. Boil macaroni according to package instructions.
1. In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, sauté onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, stir and cook until soft and fragrant  about 7 minutes. Set aside.
1. Add onions and garlic to a blender with remaining ingredients, omitting the tortilla chips and adding only half of the green chilies. Blend until smooth, using the “liquify” setting if you have it to get it really smooth. Otherwise just blend for up to a minute, scraping down sides as necessary, until smooth and creamy.
1. Drain the noodles, set aside, and cover (with a towel). To the same pot you boiled the noodles in, add the cashew cheese and cook on low stirring frequently until slightly thickened.
1. Add the macaroni noodles to the cheese, along with the remaining green chilies and stir. Serve immediately, topping with crushed toasted tortilla chips and cilantro (optional).
