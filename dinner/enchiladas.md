# black bean green chili manchego enchiladas
based on
https://minimalistbaker.com/spicy-black-bean-green-chili-manchego-enchiladas/

## ingredients
- 12 small corn or flour tortillas (I’d recommend flour)
- 1 15-ounce can black beans (drained and rinsed)
- 1 4-ounce can diced green chilies
- 1 28-ounce can red enchilada sauce (such as Las Palmas)
- 1/2 cup grated Manchego cheese (plus more for topping // or sub another Mexican cheese, such as Cojita or Pepper Jack)
- 1/4 cup light sour cream or Greek yogurt

## directions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and position a baking rack in the middle of the oven.
1. Combine black beans, green chilies, sour cream and manchego cheese in a mixing bowl. Taste and add salt and pepper if desired. Cumin may also be a good addition, but fine without. Set aside.
1. Warm 3/4 of the enchilada sauce in a large shallow pan over low-medium heat.
1. Pour a small amount of enchilada sauce to lightly coat the bottom of a 9x13 dish (adjust pan size if altering batch size).
1. Transfer one tortilla at a time to the baking dish, scoop in 2 Tbsp of the black bean filling and roll up. Place seam side down and continue until the pan is filled – should be about 10-12 enchiladas (as original recipe is written).
1. Top enchiladas with a bit more enchilada sauce down the middle (adding too much sauce can make these soggy).
1. Top with a bit more cheese and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly.
1. Serve with toppings such as avocado, guacamole, salsa, fajita veggies, sour cream, green onion, cilantro or lettuce.
1. Will keep in the fridge for a couple days. Reheat in oven or microwave.

based on https://minimalistbaker.com/butternut-squash-black-bean-enchiladas/

## ingredients

### ENCHILADAS
- 3 cups cubed butternut squash*
- 1 Tbsp avocado oil or coconut oil
- 1/4 tsp sea salt and black pepper (divided)
- 1 15-ounce can black beans (slightly drained)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin (divided)
- 7-9 white or yellow corn tortillas

### SAUCE
- 1 Tbsp avocado oil or coconut oil
- 3 cloves garlic minced (3 cloves yield ~1 1/2 Tbsp)
- 1 15-ounce can tomato sauce
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (plus additional pepper or adobo sauce for more heat)
- 1/2 cup water (or sub vegetable broth for more flavor // DIY or store-bought)
- Sea salt and black pepper (to taste)
- 1.5 tsp chipotle chili powder
- 1.5 tsp ground cumin
- 3 tsp smoked paprika

### TOPPINGS optional
- Red onion, diced
- Ripe avocado, sliced
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Toasted pumpkin seeds

## directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and position a rack in the middle of
the oven.
1. Add cubed butternut squash to a baking sheet and drizzle with oil and a pinch each salt and pepper. Toss to combine.
1. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until all squash is fork tender. Set aside to cool. Also reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (176 C).
1. In the meantime, prepare sauce. Heat large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until soft and slightly browned and translucent - about 4-5 minutes.
1. Remove pan from heat and add tomato sauce, diced chipotle pepper, more adobo sauce (if desired // for more heat), and water (or vegetable broth). Reduce heat to low and return pan to heat. Simmer for 5 minutes, covered (to prevent splattering).
1. Transfer sauce to a blender and blend well for a completely smooth sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more adobo sauce for heat, salt for savoriness, or coconut sugar for sweetness. Set aside.
1. Place same skillet used earlier back over medium heat and add black beans. Season with a little salt, pepper, cumin and stir.
1. Once bubbling, remove from heat and add roasted butternut squash and 1/4 cup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) of the enchilada sauce (see photo). Stir to coat. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Set aside.
1. Wrap tortillas in damp paper or cloth towel and microwave to warm for 30 seconds to make more pliable. (Alternatively, place tortillas directly on oven rack for 1 minute to heat through.)
1. Pour a bit of sauce into the bottom of 9×13-inch (3 quart | or similar shaped) baking dish. Spread to coat.
1. Take one corn tortilla and lay it down in the dish. Fill with generous amount of squash-bean filling (there should to be plenty for 7-9 tortillas). Then roll up tortilla.
1. Place seam side down at one end of dish. Continue until all tortillas are filled and wrapped. Then pour remaining sauce over the top of the enchiladas in a stripe down the middle. Use a spoon to distribute the sauce into the cracks. Then brush/spray the edges of the bare tortillas with oil for crispy edges (optional).
1. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, or until warmed through. Top with desired toppings and serve.
1. I love fresh lime juice, red onion, avocado, and cilantro, but these enchiladas are delicious on their own! Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, though best when fresh. Reheat in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 15-20 minutes or until warmed through.
