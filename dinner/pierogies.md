## ingredients

### Potato Filing:
- 1 lb russet potatoes (5 small), peeled
- 1 onion diced and sautéed
- 4 oz cream cheese softened
- 3 oz farmer's cheese or cheddar shredded
- salt / pepper to taste

### Pierogi Dough:
- 1 cup warm water + 2 Tbsp sour cream

OR

- 1 cup yogurt

- 1 large egg
- 2 tsp salt (plus more for cooking)
- 4 cups fresh milled whole white wheat
- Additional 1/4 cup water as needed

### Suggested toppings
- sour cream
- bacon
- chives
- butter


## directions

### Potato Filling:
1. Place potatoes in a pot, add enough water to cover potatoes then bring to
a boil over medium/high and continue cooking 25 minutes or until easily pierced
with a fork. Drain and cool 5 minutes then mash potatoes.
1. Mash in all ingredients. Partially cover and set aside while rolling out
the dough.

### Pierogi Dough:
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer (or large mixing bowl if mixing by hand), whisk
together liquid ingredients and salt until blended.
1. Using dough hook attachment, add 2 cups flour and mix on speed 2 until
incorporated. Add remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, letting it incorporate
before adding more. Add the last bit of flour 1 Tbsp at a time just until dough
no longer sticks to sides of the bowl. Knead on speed 2 or by hand for 10
minutes.
1. Let rest for at least 1 hour.

### Molding Pierogi:
1. Divide dough into 2 pieces. Cover the second piece with the mixing bowl and
thinly roll the first piece out onto a floured surface to just under 1/8”
thickness.
1. Use a 3” diameter round cookie cutter to cut circles from the dough, keeping
them as close as possible (collect scraps and place under the bowl to re-use).
Add 1/2 teaspoon of potatoes over each round.
1. To form pierogi, pull the 2 edges together and pinch tightly to seal. To ensure
a tight seal, crimp the edges a second time with a pinch and twist motion. Cook
or freeze pierogi for a future dinner (see freezing instructions in post).

### Cooking Pierogi:
1. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and add 1 Tbsp salt. Add fresh or frozen
pierogi. Once they are floating and water is back to a boil, cook additional
3-5 minutes or until dough is very tender. Remove to a bowl with a slotted
spoon drizzling buttery bacon between layers.
