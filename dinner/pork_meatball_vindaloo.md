- 1 teaspoon turmeric

- 1 teaspoon kosher salt

- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar (NOTE: less than seriouseats)
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
- 1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped
- 8 medium cloves garlic, minced

# meatballs
- 3/4 cups day-old bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 cup milk
- 1 pound ground pork
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 1 medium garlic clove, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest from 1 lemon
- Kosher salt

# vindaloo
- 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted
- 1 small red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 small yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 large jalapeño, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup grape tomatoes
- 2 cups cooked pearl couscous, for serving
- 1 1/2 tablespoons minced cilantro leaves and tender stems

# directions

1. For the Vindaloo Base: Using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind cumin
seeds, peppercorns, coriander seeds, cardamom seeds, fenugreek seeds, and black
mustard seeds until fine. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in cinnamon,
turmeric, chile powder, salt, brown sugar, and vinegar.

2. Heat vegetable oil in a sauté pan over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions
and cook, stirring often, until browned and crisp around the edges, about 12
minutes. Add ginger and garlic and cook for 2 minutes longer. Transfer to
a blender and puree until smooth, adding water 1 tablespoon at a time until
a paste forms. Transfer to bowl with spice mixture and stir to combine.

3. For the Meatballs: In a large bowl, combine bread cubes and milk and let stand
for 10 minutes. Drain bread, squeezing it dry. Discard milk. Place bread in the
bowl and thoroughly distribute and combine with pork, egg, garlic, and lemon
zest. Season with salt. Using wet hands, form mixture into 10 golf-ball-sized
balls.

4. For the Vindaloo: Warm all (NOTE: more than seriouseats) of the Spice Base in a large pot
over medium-low heat. Add canned tomatoes with their juices and stir to
combine. Add additional vindaloo paste and season with salt, if needed. Gently
nestle meatballs into sauce and simmer, basting periodically with sauce, for 10
minutes. Gently stir in red and yellow bell peppers, jalapeño, and grape
tomatoes. Continue cooking until vegetables are just tender and meatballs are
cooked through, about 5 minutes longer.

5. Serve with couscous, sprinkling cilantro on top.
