## ingredients
- 1 egg
- 1-2 Tbsp olive oil (divided // plus more for saut√©ing)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, dill, green onions (finely chopped)
- 1 Tbsp hulled white sesame seeds or hemp seeds (optional)
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp. coriander
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne
- 1 pinch sea salt and black pepper
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 3 tbsp. whole-wheat flour
- 1/2 lemon, juiced (1/2 lemon yields ~1 Tbsp or 15 ml)
- 1 15-ounce can chickpeas (drained, rinsed and thoroughly dried)

## directions
1. In a food processor, pulse garlic. Add lemon juice and let garlic sit for 5 minutes. Then add roughly chopped herbs (parsley, dill, green onions), chickpeas, sesame seeds / hemp seeds, spices, salt and pepper, egg, and flour until combined, but still chunky (not a paste!).
1. In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Spoon dough into pan and flatten/shape. Fry chickpea patties until golden, 3 minutes per side, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

## notes
- serve with [tsatziki-ish sauce](./../sauce/tsatziki_ish_suace.md) and salad
