## ingredients

### lentils (cook your own, using the ingredients below, or use one 17-ounce package of steamed French lentils instead)
- 2 cups dried black beluga lentils or French green lentils
- optional: 2 large garlic cloves, halved lengthwise
- optional: 2 large garlic cloves, halved lengthwise
- optional: salt

### Lemon dressing
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 medium lemons’ worth)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup
- 1 clove garlic, pressed or minced
- ¼ teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Salad
- 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained, or 1 ½ cups cooked chickpeas
- 1 big bunch of radishes, sliced thin and roughly chopped
- 1/2-1 cucumber, sliced thin
- ¼ cup chopped fresh, leafy herbs, chopped (combination of mint and dill recommended)
- Optional garnishes: sliced avocado, crumbled feta or goat cheese, handful of fresh leafy greens

## directions
1. To cook the lentils: Pick over the lentils to remove any bits of debris. Rinse the lentils under running water in a mesh colander. Cook the lentils like you would pasta: fill a pot with water, add lentils. Add salt, halved garlic cloves, and olive oil if you want. Gently boil until cooked through and tender, which will take somewhere between 20 to 35 minutes. Drain the lentils in cold water and discard the garlic cloves.
1. To make the dressing: Whisk together the ingredients in a small bowl. If you’re using pre-steamed lentils instead of cooking your own, add an extra clove of minced garlic and an extra tablespoon of olive oil.
1. In a large serving bowl, combine the lentils, chickpeas, radishes, cucumbers and herbs. Drizzle in the dressing and toss to combine. Serve with avocado, crumbled cheese or fresh greens if you’d like.

## notes
- chickpeas and cucumbers are optional but are nice
