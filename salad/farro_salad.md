## Ingredients
- 1½ cups farro
- 2 cups chopped kale
- ½ cup toasted pecans or walnuts
- ½ cup dried cranberries or cherries
- 1 grated carrot
- ⅓ cup chopped scallions
- handful of parsley, chopped
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup crumbled feta or goat cheese

## Instructions
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add farro and cook for about 15 minutes until tender, stirring occasionally. Drain well in a fine mesh strainer, set aside to cool.
Toast the pecans over medium-low heat in a saute pan, stirring often to prevent from burning. Should take about 5 minutes.
Add chopped kale to a large bowl and massage until slightly wilted - you don't have to do this but it helps break down the kale making it easier to eat.
Add grated carrot, cooled pecans, cooled farro, cranberries, parsley and scallions to the bowl with the kale and mix. Add lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper and mix again. Lastly, fold in the crumbled feta or goat cheese. Enjoy room temperature or chilled.
