#Jewish Rye Bread
from https://www.restlesschipotle.com/jewish-rye-bread-secret-getting-right/

Servings: 3 loaves, 10 slices each


##Ingredients
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
2 cups water 110F
1/2 cup dill pickle brine (from a jar of your favorite dill pickles)
1/2 cup your favorite mild flavored oil (I use peanut oil, sometimes olive oil)
4 to 5 cups bread flour
2 cups dark rye flour, preferably stone ground organic
1/2 cup dried potato flakes
1/4 cup dried onions, optional
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup caraway seed
1/4 cup brown sugar, tightly packed

##Instructions
1. Add the water and the sugar to the yeast in the large bowl of your mixer, or a large bowl if doing this by hand.
2. Let stand 5 minutes. The mixture will be bubbly.
3. Add the remaining ingredients, using only 2 cups of the bread flour and reserving the rest.
4. With the mixer running add the remaining flour, a half cup at a time, until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is firm but still slightly sticky. (Rye dough will always be sticky - it feels different than other doughs)
5. Turn out on a lightly floured counter top and knead a couple of times.
6. Form into a ball.
7. Oil a large bowl and add the ball of dough.
8. Oil the top of the dough and cover with a clean towel.
9. Let rise for one hour, or until doubled.
10. Preheat oven to 350F.
11. Punch dough down and shape into 3 oval loaves.
12. Place loaves on a lightly floured baking sheet.
13. Sprinkle tops with bread flour - not too much.
14. Slash tops with a sharp knife.
15. Let rise 30 minutes.
16. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until done.
17. Let cool before slicing.


##Notes
- onion flakes may be overwhelming
