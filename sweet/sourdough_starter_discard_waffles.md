# Sourdough starter discard waffles 
From https://www.theperfectloaf.com/my-top-3-leftover-sourdough-starter-recipes/


## Ingredients
- 460g (2 cups) buttermilk
- 110g (1/2 cup) water
- 126g(1/2 cup or 1 stick) butter, melted and cooled
- 100g (1/2 cup, stirred down) ripe sourdough starter
- 250g (2 cups) all-purpose flour, einkorn flour, or a mix of all-purpose and whole wheat
- 7g (1 1/2 teaspoon) raw sugar
- 2 eggs
- 5g (1 teaspoon) sea salt
- 3g (1/2 teaspoon) baking soda


## Directions

### The night before:
1. Add buttermilk and the melted and cooled butter to a large mixing bowl. 
2. Then add your ripe sourdough starter and mix thoroughly (use a whisk and your hands if needed). 
3. Sprinkle the sugar on top and whisk in your flour, a little at a time, until incorporated.
4. If necessary, use some of the 100g (1/2 cup) reserved water to break up the batter until it resembles a traditional pancake batter. If you have a 100% hydration starter, you probably won’t need to add any water, but if your flour is extra “thirsty” or you have a stiff starter it might be necessary.
5. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature overnight.

### In the morning:
1. Warm your whole eggs to room temperature by letting them sit for a few minutes in a bowl of warm water. 
2. Sift the baking soda and salt onto the top of the batter. 
3. Crack the eggs and place the whites in one clean bowl and the yolks in another. Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. 
4. Lightly scramble up the egg yolks in the second bowl. Pour the yolks into the batter and gently stir through. 
5. Then, using a spatula, fold the eggs whites into the mixture until just incorporated (and no more).
6. Cook in your smoking hot waffle iron until done to your liking.


## Notes
- we forgot the butter and it was fine but yes it could have been better
- ratio of starter to flour in this recipe is 1:4, but can be at least 1:3, if not 1:2
