# keto cheesecake:

## crust:

### ingredients:

- 355 mL (1.5 cups) almond flour
- 120 mL (0.5 cups, 58g) ground pecans
- 1 stick           butter
- 80 mL (1/3 cups)  ethevia 0.2.0

### directions:

**note**: There is no need to butter or spray pan-crust will not stick.

1. Preheat oven to 175C (350F)
1. Put all ingredients in food processor and mix until well incorporated.
1. Press well into and up sides of a 9”x1½” round removable bottom cake pan or a 9” springform pan. I prefer to use a cake pan-it is deeper than a tart pan.
1. Blind bake in preheated 350 degree oven 10 minutes.
1. Remove from oven and “tamp down” bottom and sides. You want the crust to be ‘dense’.
1. Put back in oven until it just begins to brown.
1. Remove from oven and maintain heat.
