# directions
1 Preheat your oven to 350°F (176.6°C).
1. In a large mixing bowl combine flour, baking soda, and salt.
1. In a small bowl mix a handful of chopped walnuts and a few pinches of sugar. Set aside to be used as the topping later.
1. In another bowl (or a stand mixer) cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time. While mixing, scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add in sourdough starter, honey, mashed bananas, vanilla, and olive oil. Then, add in the flour mixture slowly, pausing to scrape down the sides if necessary. By hand, fold in the remaining walnuts and lemon zest. Pour the batter into the 9” x 5” baking pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Sprinkle on the reserved chopped walnuts and sugar.
1. Bake for 55-65 minutes until the internal temp right in the middle is 200-205°F (93-96°C). Let cool in pan for 10 minutes and then gently remove onto a wire rack to thoroughly cool.
