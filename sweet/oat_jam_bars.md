# ingredients

## For the base
- 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 cup almond meal
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1/3 cup coconut oil, solid
- 2 tablespoons almond milk (or other vegan milk)
- Pinch salt
- 1/2 cup jam

## For the oat topping
- 3/4 cup quick oats
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil, solid or melted

# directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a 8Ã—8-inch pan with parchment paper and set aside.
1. First make the base. In a food processor (or using a bowl and fork), pulse the whole wheat flour, almond meal, brown sugar, and salt until combined. Add the coconut oil and pulse until evenly distributed. Add the almond milk, one tablespoon at a time, and pulse until the mixture forms large clumps.
1. Press the dough evenly into the pan, using your fingertips to pat down until smooth. Spread the jam evenly across the top of the dough.
1. Now make the topping. In a small bowl, mix together the oats, cinnamon, sugar, and coconut oil. The mixture will not form clumps. Spread the oat mixture across the top of the jam until covered.
1. Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown. Let cool until slicing.
