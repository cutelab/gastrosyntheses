# chocolate sandwich cookies
based on https://bromabakery.com/espresso-brownie-sandwich-cookies/

# ingredients
- 1/2 cup butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1 large egg, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup cocoa
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda


# directions
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease or line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.
1. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, cream butter and brown sugar on medium for 2 minutes. Add in the egg, vanilla extract, and salt and beat 1 minute more.
1. Turn mixer to low and mix in cocoa, flour, and baking soda, mixing until just combined.
1. Use a 1/2 oz cookie scoop (or use a 1 oz cookie scoop and divide the dough in half) to scoop balls of dough. Roll each ball between palms to form perfect circle, then place on prepared baking sheet and push down slightly, making a slightly flattened disk. You should have between 36-38 scoops of dough.
1. Bake for 7 minutes, then remove from heat and allow cookies to cool on baking sheets until they reach room temperature.

# notes
- feel free to put some coffee in too (increase cocao/flour a bit to account for extra moisture)
- texture: soft, sandy (almost crumbly)
- instead of using a cookie scoop, i rolled out the dough (between sheets of plastic wrap) and cut out circles, for more evenly sized and shaped cookies.
- eat with ice cream :)
