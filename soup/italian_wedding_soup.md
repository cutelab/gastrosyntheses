# italian wedding soup
Based on https://www.bonappetit.com/columns/cooking-without-recipes/article/fast-italian-wedding-soup

# ingredients
- chicken sausages from trader joe's
- parmesan
- breadcrumbs
- yellow onion
- 2 carrots
- 2 garlic cloves
- red pepper flakes
- 1 can white cannellini beans
- 1-2L chicken stock
- ditalini pasta / Israeli couscous / orzo
- shredded greens (kale, collards, chard)

# directions
1. Remove one package of fresh spicy chicken sausages from their casings and form the meat into very small meatballs before rolling in a mixture of homemade breadcrumbs and grated Parm (grate extra to top the soup later). 
1. Pan-fry until they're golden brown on all sides.
1. For the soup, sauté the usual suspects in a pot—a chopped small yellow onion, two diced carrots, a few minced garlic cloves, red pepper flakes and a can of white cannellini beans. 
1. Add enough stock (I use homemade vegetable or chicken, which I keep in the freezer, but store-bought is totally fine) to cover the veg by a few inches. Bring to a boil.
1. Add pasta. Stir in a big bunch of shredded greens like kale, collards, or chard, as well as the crispy meatballs. Simmer until the meatballs are cooked through and pasta is al dente.
1. Garnish with a spoonful of that pesto that's been sitting in your freezer and, obviously, that grated Parm.

# notes
- smaller meatballs are more fun
- for your own sake don't look at the picture of italian wedding soup on wikipedia
