## Ingredients
- 1 pound beets (beetroot), peeled and cut into matchsticks
- 2 medium onions, sliced into half-moons
- 2 large carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks
- 3/4 pound red cabbage, cut thinly into shreds
- tablespoons olive oil

- Salt to taste
- Coarsely ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon caraway seed
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- 1 cup tomato puree

## Directions
1. Cut the onions, carrots, and beets. (alternatively, shred the carrots and beets using the shredding blade of a food processor)

2. Heat oil in a large soup pot. Add onions, caraway seeds. Once onions are translucent, add carrots and beets.

3. In the meantime, bring the vegetable stock to a boil. When the vegetables are soft (about 5 minutes), add the shredded cabbage, hot stock, and tomato puree. Bring to a boil and simmer 15-25 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.
