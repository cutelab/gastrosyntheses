### Sauce:

#### Noodles & Veg:
- 1 pound fresh or dried white noodles (450g, medium thickness)
- 1 small bunch leafy greens (spinach, bok choy, or choy sum)
- chopped peanuts
- chopped scallion (optional)


## directions
1. To make the meat mixture: In a wok, heat a teaspoon of oil over medium heat, and brown the ground pork. Add the sweet bean sauce, shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce, and five spice powder. Cook until all the liquid is evaporated. Set aside. Heat the other 2 teaspoons of oil in the wok over medium heat, and sautee the sui mi ya cai (pickled vegetables) for a few minutes. Set aside.
1. To make the sauce: Mix together all the sauce ingredients. Taste and adjust seasoning if you like. You can loosen it with more hot water, add more Sichuan peppercorn powder, etc.
1. To prepare the noodles and veggies: Cook the noodles according to package directions and drain. Blanch the greens in the noodle water, and drain.
1. Divide the sauce among four bowls, followed by the noodles and the leafy greens. Add the cooked pork and sui mi ya cai over the top. Sprinkle with chopped peanuts (optional) and scallions.
1. Mix everything together and enjoy!

## notes
- substitutes for meat: beyond meat, OR chopped (roughly food-processed) rehydrated shiitake mushrooms and crumbled tempeh work great!
