## ingredients
### Noodle dough
- 300 g all-purpose flour , 2 cups
- 2 g salt
- 130 ml to 140ml water

### Sauce
- 2 tablespoons chili powder+pinch of salt
- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 2 garlic clove , minced
- 2 green onion , minced
- green vegetable for blanching
- 2 tablespoons vegetable cooking oil
- oil for brushing

## directions

### To make the noodle dough
1. In a large bowl, mix salt with flour. And stir in water by batches. I usually add 130ml firstly and then see whether the dough is too tough to knead. Less water indicates a chewier taste. Grasp everything by hand and continue kneading the dough until smooth. Forcefully please or resort to a standard mixer. Cover with plastic wrapper and rest for 20 minutes.
1. Knead the dough again for several minutes until the surface is really smooth as I show in the video. Cover with plastic wrapper again and rest for another 15-20 minutes
1. Prepare a plate and brush some vegetable oil on surface. And then cut the noodle dough into halves and each half into 6 portions (as equal as possible and cover the other half with plastic wrapper to avoid drying out ). So we will end up with 12 portions. Shape each one into a long log and brush oil around. Cover with plastic wrapper and let the noodle strip log rest for 1 hour.
1. Take one portion out, flat it and roll out to a rectangle. Press the center with a chopstick so we can separate the noodles later. Hold the two ends of the noodle strip and smash it against the operating board. You can slightly stretch it during the smashing process. But do not hurry; slow down so that you will not break it.
1. And the separate the noodles along with the chop sticker trace.

### To cook and assemble the noodles
1. Boil water in pot and add noodles in. If you feel they shrink, stretch each strip slightly. Bring the large pot to boil.
1. Add cold water once after it boils again. And then add green vegetable to blanch. The whole process of cooking lasts for around 4 minutes. Transfer out to serving bowl.
1. In the mean time, heat up 2 tablespoons of cooking oil in a small pot until slightly smoky.
1. Place garlic, green onion and chili peppers on top and pour the hot oil over the noodles (mainly on the chili powders). Add soy sauce and vinegar and combine well.
