- 1 tablespoon butter or vegetable oil
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt

# instructions
1. prepare two large baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. depending on how large you roll out and shape your pretzels, you should be able to fit 6 per 13 x 18″ (“half-size“) sheet.

1. mix and knead the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a cohesive, fairly smooth dough. it should be slightly sticky; if it seems dry, knead in an additional tablespoon or two of water.

1. cover the dough and let it rest for 45 minutes. it will rise minimally. towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°f.

1. turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface, fold it over a few times to gently deflate it, then divide it into 12 pieces, each weighing about 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 ounces.

1. roll each piece of dough into a cigar around 8 inches long.

1. starting with the piece preshaped first, place the cigar in front of you so the tips are at your sides. begin with your hands slightly overlapping in the middle, press down and roll the dough back and forth away from and then toward your body. as you are rolling, start to move your hands outward to encourage the tube to spread out and become increasingly thin as you move from the center out to the tips. you want to keep an exaggerated bulge in the very center of this rope, this will be the part you later score to open in the oven. additionally, classic technique suggests leaving small little bulbs at the extremes of the rope.

1. shape each rope into a pretzel.

1. bring baking soda and 9 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. drop 1-2
   pretzels into the boiling water for 20-30 seconds. place on prepared baking
   sheet

1. brush each pretzel with the egg white and sprinkle on coarse salt

1. bake the pretzels for 25 to 30 minutes, until they're a light golden brown. note: this is correct; there's no need to let the shaped pretzels rise before baking.
