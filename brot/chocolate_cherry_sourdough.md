1. BULK RISE, part 2 (6 times, 3hrs): 1 fold every 30 min, with 30 min rest after final fold. after first fold, add chocolate and cherries.
1. MIDDLE CYCLE: DIVIDE: you probably want 1kg boules, so if you are making 1x this recipe's quantity, you wouldn't want to divide the dough.
1. MIDDLE CYCLE: PRESHAPE
1. MIDDLE CYCLE: REST (20 min): rest.
1. FINAL SHAPING: do the folding thing.

1. PROOFING (3-4 hrs, or overnight in fridge): to check if the dough is properly proofed, gently press the exposued surface of the dough for 2s; the pressure should leave a smal ldent in the dough; it will slowly spring back, but the indentatio should remain clearly visible after 1-2s.

1. BAKING: score loaf. transfer loaf to oven.
1. BAKING: lower temperature to 450F. bake for 30 min with lid on.

# notes
- to compare this to the tartine sourdough recipe: the amount of levain to the rest of the flour is about doubled. 
- high hydration is important.i
- this bread is especially enjoyable if quite moist, like chocolate cake.
- serving suggestion: slices with mascaropone cheese and honey.
