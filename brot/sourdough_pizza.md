Based on Cheeseboard Collective's sourdough pizza dough recipe

## Ingredients
- 3-3.5 cups bread flour (all-purpose also works fine, and you can substitute about 1 cup of whole wheat flour if desired)
- 1.5 cups cool water
- 1.5 tspns kosher salt
- 0.5 cup (4 oz) sourdough starter

Makes about five 12 inch pizzas.

## Dough Directions
1. Put 3 cups of the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl.
1. [5min mix + 10min rest + 15min mix] If using a stand mixer, add the water to the bowl and mix on low speed with the paddle attachment until the ingredients are thoroughly combined, about 3 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes. Add the salt and sourdough starter. Switch to the dough hook, increase the mixer speed to medium, and knead for 12 minutes, or until the dough is slightly tacky and soft. (After a couple of minutes, the dough should gather around the hook; you can add extra flour by the tablespoonful if the dough does not pull away from the sides of the bowl.) Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for about 5 minutes), or until the dough is smooth, shiny, and passes the windowpane test.
1. [5min mix + 10min rest + 15min mix] If making by hand, add the water to the bowl and mix with a wooden spoon until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Let rest for 10 minutes. Add the salt and sourdough starter and mix until all the ingredients are combined. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for 15 minutes, adding flour by the tablespoonful as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. The kneading is complete when the dough is smooth, shiny, and passes the windowpane test.
1. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a large oiled bowl. Turn the dough over to coat it with oil.
1. [6hrs or overnight] Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let rise in a cool place for 6 to 8 hours, or until the dough is doubled in size. Or, put the dough into the refrigerator and let it rise overnight; the next day, let it stand at room temperature for 2 hours before proceeding with the recipe.
1. To shape the pizzas, transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and divide it into ~200g pieces. Gently form each piece into a loose round and cover with a floured kitchen towel.
1. At this point, begin pizza directions.

## Pizza Directions
1. Preheat oven on broiler mode, with cast iron in the oven, on the highest possible rack.
1. [20min] Let dough rest for 20 minutes.
1. Scatter cornmeal over a flat moveable surface (e.g. cutting board or inverted baking sheet). Shape round into a disk that will fit in a cast iron pan. Brush disk top with olive oil.
1. Remove cast iron from oven. Slide dough into the pan. Put on toppings.
1. [6.5min] Bake for 6.5 min. Aim for slightly browned crust / ingredients on top. Watch closely as it may take less or more time.
1. [5min] Remove pan from oven, and continue cooking the pizza on the stovetop to brown the bottom (~5min). Again, watch closely.

## Topping suggestions
- Cheese (mozz, parmesan/hard, goat/feta/soft), red onion, sauteed mushrooms, garlic, canned corn
- if making a no-red-sauce pizza, serve with green sauce (papi chulo / chimichurri sauce)
- https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/perfect-pizza: imported mozzarella di bufala, fior di latte mozzarella, maitake mushrooms, calabrian chiles, pizza sauce, garlic clove, parmesan, basil, lemon

## Notes
- more thinner crust = more better pizza
