# Steamed buns
Adapted from https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/steamed-bao-buns

## Ingredients
- 525g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1.5 tbsp caster sugar, plus a pinch
- 1 tsp fast-action dried yeast
- 50ml milk
- 1 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for greasing and brushing
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp baking powder

## Directions
1. MIX: Mix together 525g plain flour, 1½ tbsp caster sugar and ½ tsp salt in a large bowl (tip: The dough can easily be made in a mixer with a dough hook up to the end of step 3).
1. MIX: Dissolve 1 tsp fast-action dried yeast and a pinch of sugar in 1 tbsp warm water, then add it to the flour with 50ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower oil, 1 tbsp rice vinegar and 200ml water. Mix into a dough, adding a little extra water if needed.
1. MIX: Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10-15 mins, or until smooth. 
1. PRIMARY FERMENTATION (2 hrs): Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave to rise for 2 hrs, or until doubled in size.
1. PUNCH: Tip the dough out onto a clean work surface and punch it down. Flatten the dough with your hands, then sprinkle over 1 tsp baking powder and knead for 5 mins.
1. MIDDLE: DIVIDE: Roll out the dough into a long sausage shape, about 3cm thick, then cut into pieces that are about 3cm wide – you should have 18.
1. MIDDLE: ROUNDING + BENCHING: In the palm of your hand, roll each piece of dough into a ball and leave to rest for 2-3 mins.
1. SHAPE: Use a rolling pin to roll out each ball, one by one, into an oval shape about 3-4mm thick. Rub the surface of the dough ovals with oil and brush a little oil over a chopstick.
1. SHAPE: Place the oiled chopstick in the centre of each oval. Fold the dough over the chopstick, then slowly pull out the chopstick.
1. PROOF (1.5 hrs): Cut 18 squares of baking parchment and put a bun on each. Transfer to a baking tray, cover with a clean tea towel or lightly oiled cling film and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hr 30 mins, or until doubled in size.
1. STEAM: Heat a large steamer over a medium-high heat. Steam the buns for 8 mins until puffed up (you’ll need to do this in batches).
1. Prise open each bun and fill with our barbecue pork and pickled carrot & mooli. Eat while they’re still warm.

## Notes
- When shaping, oil the uglier side and make that the inside of the bun
- The buns can be steamed, then frozen. Once defrosted, simply reheat in a steamer.
