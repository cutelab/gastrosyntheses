2. heat pan. add oil and salt.
3. pour starter (1/2 cup, or whatever size pancake you want to make) on top of
   salt.
4. top with salt, scallions, sesame seeds, and a bit more oil.
5. once pancake is halfway cooked (look at the sides of the pancake), flip.
   press down slightly to make sure scallions and sesame seeds embed themselves

# notes
- serving suggestion: cut into wedges.
- still not sure what a good sauce pairing is. hoisin+garlic+sesame oil
  perhaps?
- still not sure what the best starter hydration is.

# variations
- plain: just salt
- cheddar
- kimchi + cheddar
