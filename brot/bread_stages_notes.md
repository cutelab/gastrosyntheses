# 12 stages of bread
(from Peter Reinhart's _The Bread Baker's Apprentice_)

1. Mise en place
2. Mixing: 1) distributing the ingredients, 2) developing the gluten, 3) initiating fermentation
3. Primary fermentation / bulk fermentation
4. Punching down / de-gassing
5. Middle cycle: Dividing
6. Middle cycle: Rounding: interim shaping
7. Middle cycle: Benching / resting / intermediate proofing
8. Shaping + panning: final shaping
9. Proofing / secondary fermentation / final fermentation
10. Baking ( + scoring, steaming): 1) gelatinization of the starches, 2) carmelization of the sugars, 3) coagulation and roasting of the proteins
11. Cooling
12. Storing + eating

# Float Test
Do this test to determine if your starter/levain is at peak maturity (exponential growth phase), and ready to mix.

Fill a glass with water. Use a spoon to remove some starter and drop it into the water. If it floats, it passes the test. If it doesn't float, it failed the test.

If you poke your starter sample too much, you might remove all the CO2 pockets in it that would have allowed it to float.

After you make the levain, start testing it every hour. We typically find that our levain begins to pass the float test in 3 hours, and will use it then.

# Poke Test
This test can be done once the dough has had some time to ferment. Poke your finger into the dough about a half inch deep. Does the dough ‘recover’ by popping back out? or does it stay where it is? If:

- The dough pops back out quickly  This means it’s under-proofed.
- The dough stays where it is  This means it’s over-proofed.
- The dough pops back out slowly and leaves a slight indentation  Perfect, your dough is ready!
