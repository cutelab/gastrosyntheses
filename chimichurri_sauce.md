# Chimichurri Sauce

## Ingredients

- fresh parsley
- fresh cilantro
- oregano (dried or fresh)
- red wine vinegar
- cumin
- garlic
- oil
- salt, pepper
- red pepper flakes
- chile (e.g. aneheim chile pepper)

## Instructions
1. pulse everything in a food processor.


## Notes
- common failure mode #1: watery sauce. dry off the parsley+cilantro well before pulsing
- common failure mode #2: too strong garlic. don't use too much (e.g. 2 cloves max), and temper by soaking cut garlic in vinegar first.
